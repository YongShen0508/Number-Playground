# Java-Based Mobile Game Application
## Project Introduction
* This project aims to develop an interactive mathematics learning app designed for children.  
* The app will help young learners improve their numerical understanding through engaging activities and interactive gameplay.  
* By incorporating fun and intuitive exercises, the app makes learning math enjoyable while enhancing problem-solving skills.  
* The primary focus is on three key concepts: comparing numbers, ordering numbers, and composing numbers.  
* Through hands-on interaction, children will build confidence in working with numbers, laying a strong foundation for their mathematical development.

## Tools used
* android studio

## Features in our app
✔ Compare Numbers (Greater Than & Less Than)
* Helps children become familiar with numeric values.  
* Allows them to compare two numbers and determine which is greater or smaller.  

✔ Ordering of Numbers (Ascending & Descending Order)
* Teaches children how to arrange numbers in both ascending and descending order.  
* Encourages them to organize a set of random numbers correctly.  
  
✔ Composing Numbers (Building Numbers from Parts)

* Demonstrates how numbers can be formed by combining smaller numbers.  
* Encourages children to find different number pair combinations to match a given value.
